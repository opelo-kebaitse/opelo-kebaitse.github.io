      <p>
        Hello. I'm Opelo, originally from Botswana, currently residing in Auckland. As someone who values innovation, I have always been fascinated by the potential of technology to bring about positive change. That's why I'm attending Dev Academy - I work for a tech startup, and after seeing the cool work done by our software developers, I was inspired to learn more and develop my own skills in this field. I think technology is really awesome in the way it can transform our lives, and I want to be a part of that change.

      <h2>Passions</h2>
      <p>
        Outside the realm of coding, you'll find me indulging in my passions. I absolutely love traveling and dream of exploring the beautiful Caribbean one day. Photography is another passion of mine; capturing moments and telling stories through pictures brings me immense joy. Music is my soul food, and attending concerts is one of my favorite ways to immerse myself in its magic. I also love nature, and you'll often find me hiking and exploring the great outdoors.

      <h2>Cuisine</h2>
      <p>
        Food is another great love of mine, especially Italian cuisine. But I'm always up for discovering new vegetarian delights from different cultures. If you know any hidden gems for food in New Zealand, feel free to give me a shout!
