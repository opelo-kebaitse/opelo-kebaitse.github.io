    <h1>Emotional intelligence</h1>
    <h2>What is emotional intelligence?</h2>
    <p>
      Emotional intelligence, also known as emotional quotient or EQ, revolves around comprehending, utilising, and managing one's own emotions in positive ways. It aids in alleviating stress, communicating effectively, empathising with others, overcoming challenges, and defusing conflicts. Possessing emotional intelligence enables you to foster stronger relationships, excel academically and professionally, and accomplish your personal and career objectives. It also assists in connecting with your emotions, transforming intentions into action, and making well-informed decisions regarding what truly matters to you.
