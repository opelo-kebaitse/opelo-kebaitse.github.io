    <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.</h2>
      <p>
        Situation: I confronted a childhood friend about their lack of respect towards people's choice of genders.<br>
        Values: Respect, inclusivity, empathy.<br>
        Decision: I chose to speak out and express my concerns to my friend, emphasising the importance of respecting individuals' gender choices.<br>
        Reflection: Looking back, I believe my decision was ethical because it aligned with my values of promoting respect and inclusivity. It allowed me to stand up for what I believe in and advocate for the rights and dignity of others.
      </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>
      <p>
        Culture: Although my culture is conservative, I have been fortunate to have a family that embraces diversity and non-conventional ideas.<br>
        People: Through my travels, I have met friends from diverse backgrounds, which has exposed me to new perspectives and broadened my understanding of the world.<br>
        Influence: These experiences have shaped my values of openness, acceptance, and the appreciation of different cultures and viewpoints. They have also contributed to the development of my identity as someone who values diversity and seeks to challenge societal norms.

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h2>
      <p>
        Strengths: Self-motivated, adaptable, good problem-solving skills.<br>
        Support: My self-motivation keeps me driven to pursue my learning goals and overcome challenges. Being adaptable allows me to adjust to different learning environments and approaches. Additionally, my problem-solving skills help me navigate complex tasks and find effective solutions, enhancing my learning experience.
      </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>
      <p>
        Limitations: Overanalysing situations, difficulties in public speaking.<br>
        Impact: Overanalysing can sometimes lead to overthinking and indecisiveness, potentially hindering progress. Difficulties in public speaking can limit my ability to effectively communicate and present ideas in professional settings.<br>
        Learning Journey: To address these limitations, I would focus on developing strategies to manage overanalysis, such as setting clear decision-making criteria and seeking input from others. For public speaking, I would practice and seek opportunities to gradually build confidence, such as joining public speaking clubs or seeking feedback from mentors.

    <div class="section">
      <h2>5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.</h2>
      <p>
        Situation: Planning ahead at work for a busy week, but encountering resistance and tension from colleagues.<br>
        Strategies employed: I initiated a team meeting on Friday afternoon to discuss and plan for the upcoming week. I emphasised the benefits of early planning and addressing potential issues in advance. I actively listened to my colleagues' concerns and suggestions and encouraged open dialogue.<br>
        Effectiveness: The strategies were partially effective in reducing tension and promoting collaboration. However, some colleagues still resisted the idea, leading to compromises in the planning process.<br>
        Reflection: In hindsight, I realise that more emphasis on the benefits and clear communication of expectations could have improved the effectiveness of my strategies. Additionally, acknowledging and addressing individual concerns in a more personalised manner might have helped build trust and cooperation. In the future, I would focus on fostering a positive and supportive team environment, actively seeking input from all team members, and finding common ground to minimise resistance.
