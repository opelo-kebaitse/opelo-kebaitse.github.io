      <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Core learning has revealed that I'm more capable than I realise, and I shouldn't limit myself based on self-imposed limitations.</li>
        <li>I've learnt about the concept of neuroplasticity, which empowers me to rewire my brain and develop new skills. It's crucial to apply this understanding, especially during challenging times, as that's when real growth happens.</li>
        <li>I've realised the power of self-compassion and celebrating all successes, no matter how small. Recognising my progress and achievements is essential for nurturing a healthy ego and staying motivated throughout the learning journey.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
      <p>The role of values in programming is to guide ethical decision-making, while empathy enables a deeper understanding of user needs. Self-awareness plays a vital role in personal growth and improvement. Integrating these aspects allows programmers to establish ethical practices and embrace ongoing learning.</p>

      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>What has surprised me the most about the core learning is devAcademy's willingness to address and openly discuss the mental and emotional aspects that can be challenging and uncomfortable. I've been pleasantly surprised by how valuable and helpful this approach has been in helping me overcome mental obstacles. It's been a refreshing and supportive experience, and I'm truly grateful for the emphasis placed on addressing these important aspects of personal growth and learning.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>One of the most challenging aspects of core learning is the requirement to confront ourselves and delve deep into our inner selves. It can be a difficult process because it entails stripping away layers and allowing ourselves to be vulnerable, which can be uncomfortable and unsettling. It pushes us outside of our comfort zones and forces us to confront our fears, weaknesses, and limiting beliefs. This level of self-examination can be challenging because it requires us to confront aspects of ourselves that we may have been avoiding or denying. It can be an intense and emotional journey. However, I have discovered that through this process, we have the opportunity to grow, evolve, and break free from self-imposed limitations.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
      <p>I believe DevAcademy equips students with core skills because it is well understood that success in the workplace extends beyond technical proficiency alone. The emphasis on core learning reflects DevAcademy's recognition of the importance of providing students with the necessary tools to thrive in a professional environment and meet the demands of employers who value not only technical abilities but also strong interpersonal and communication skills. By focusing on core learning, DevAcademy aims to produce well-rounded students.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer</h2>
      <p>No, the time I spent studying core learning here does not feel like a waste of time. I recognise the importance of core learning in making me more employable. It provides me with valuable skills that go beyond technical knowledge and contribute to my professional growth. Core learning also helps me overcome mental blocks and address any potential obstacles that could impact my learning when studying the technical sections. I believe it builds a strong foundation for my overall development as a programmer.</p>
